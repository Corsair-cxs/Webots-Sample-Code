# Day2 Worlds and Samples

### Worlds

The C++ day two world is a slightly modified version of the world used in day two of the [python tutorials](https://github.com/Shadow149/RescueMaze/wiki/Tutorial-2:-Sensing-&-Victim-Detection) with gyro sensors and a heat victim added in. (Credits to Alfred Roberts and Robbie Goldman for creation of the world).
