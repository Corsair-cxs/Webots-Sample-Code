# Erebus-Sample-Code
Sample code and worlds for the RCJ rescue simulation game in Webots.

Each daily webinar will have its own folder for sample code and worlds.

Under ErebusSamples/ you will find sample code specifically for the Erebus simulation world in C++ and Python. NOTE that this is separate and unrelated to the RCJ simulation game, but still possibly helpful to learn from.
